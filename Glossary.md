# Glossary

**Backpropagation**: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train
artificial neural networks. It works by iteratively adjusting the
weights of connections between nodes (neurons) in the network based on
how well it predicts output values for a given input set. The process
involves computing error at each node and then propagating this error
back through the network to update the weights, with errors being
calculated using a chain rule approach that takes into account all
previous layers of the network. This iterative process continues until
the network's accuracy is within an acceptable threshold or until
convergence is reached. Backpropagation has become one of the most
widely used algorithms in machine learning due to its effectiveness
and simplicity, as well as its ability to handle a wide range of
problems from image recognition to natural language processing.
